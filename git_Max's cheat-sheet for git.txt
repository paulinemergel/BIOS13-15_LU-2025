#Git Cheat Sheet (for windows CMD)
# Max Weber - with the help of ChatGPT

# Create a new git repository (in an already existing folder)
git init

# Connect git to GitHub repository
git remote add origin <link to the github repository>
# you will probably be asked for you name and email address, input the same ones you use on g

#Stage file changes for commiting
git add .

#Show staged files
git status # not necessary

#Commit Changes
git commit -m "Message"

#Push to GitHub
git push origin main # main is sometimes master

# Pull changes from GitHub (overrides local copy with GitHub version)
git pull origin main

#Keeping a pdf file in a repo without tracking changes (for static pdf file):
#Add file once
	git add exercise_instructions.pdf
	git commit -m "Add exercise instructions"
#Tell Git to ignore future changes:
	git update-index --assume-unchanged "Running Exercise Assignment 13.10.25/exercise_instructions.pdf"
	#Prevents Git from noticing or staging future edits to that file. The file stays in the repo, just “frozen".
#Allow changes again (undo)
	git update-index --no-assume-unchanged "Running Exercise Assignment 13.10.25/exercise_instructions.pdf"
#Only affecty local git, if pulled from github to another device, it must be run again


# Usage of .gitignore
# git will ignore all files that are in the repository that are listet in gitignore.
 This is useful if you have files like pdfs or images, because git cannot keep track of their changes, so it will save a new copy with every commit and bloat your storage.
*.zip
*.pptx
*.pdf
*.docx
# putting this into .gitignore in the main folder of your repository will make git ignore all zip files, powerpoint files pdf and word documents.
