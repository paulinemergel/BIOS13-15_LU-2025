GIT 

master and main are different branches in git

I am using master

local and github branch must be the same


.gitignore (textfile): 
for files that I don't want git to see
for files that git cannot work with (zip, pptx, pdf, docs, etc) => would just increase storage space
you can reference whole subfolders, e.g. */Given Scripts and Lectures (gitignore)/


You can also set git/r up in a way that it ONLY tracks .r-files
